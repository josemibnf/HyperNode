### Why Ergo was Selected as the Path Forward for Celaut

Ergo was selected because its principles align with those of Celaut, as reflected in the Ergo Manifesto (available in [Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/)).
Furthermore, its advanced technology and a community dedicated to these ideals reinforce its suitability.

It has been observed that no other network genuinely upholds these principles, as many tend to corporatize the products built on them, centralizing control in one way or another *(according to the developers of celaut-project/node).*

For this reason, Ergo is considered the path forward.

**P.D.**  Ergo was chosen as the initial network to implement the necessary contracts for Celaut, although it is not necessarily the only ledger to be used. Celaut allows the simultaneous use of multiple ledgers, providing flexibility in its implementation across different networks.
