# Nodo: Service Orchestration for Distributed Networks

Nodo is a powerful framework designed to streamline communication, management, and orchestration of services 
across a network of computers. 

In a network where
services are specialized software components encapsulated within binary files, and nodes represent the computers in 
the network responsible for discovering and establishing connections with other nodes 
(aka [CELAUT](https://github.com/celaut-project/celaut-architecture/blob/master/README.md)).

[As is described in the architecture](https://github.com/celaut-project/celaut-architecture/blob/master/README.md#node-responsabilities), 
it's responsibilities are:

1. **Service Execution**: Handles service instance requests, balancing the load between running them 
locally or on its peer nodes. This ensures an efficient distribution of tasks and resources across the network, 
optimizing system performance.

2. **Communication Interface**: Provides a robust and flexible interface that enables the services that it executes
to communicate seamlessly with it, ensuring efficient data exchange and coordination. To accomplish this task, Nodo utilizes  [Pee-RPC](https://github.com/pee-rpc-protocol/pee-rpc),
a protocol built on top of gRPC that enables the seamless transfer of complete services without compromising the integrity of [CELAUT's principles](https://github.com/celaut-project/celaut-architecture/blob/master/README.md#principles).

3. **Address and Token Provisioning**: Offers a streamlined process for obtaining the communication address and 
authentication token of a service required for interaction, enhancing security and accessibility.

4. **Dependency Management**: Takes care of ensuring that services have access to the addresses of their 
dependencies, irrespective of the node on which they are executed, promoting a smooth and efficient service ecosystem.

5. **Service Compilation**: Although it is not necessarily a CELAUT node's responsibility, this implementation allows you to send
a Dockerfile along with a configuration file and a zip file and get a specification for that service, making it a hassle-free process for users (or bots ...).


## Installation

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celaut-project/nodo/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```

### Note on Installation

- **sudo Usage**: The installation script requires `sudo` privileges to install various apt packages and Docker. Use it responsibly under your own discretion.

- **Docker Containers**: The system will create and remove Docker containers as part of its operations.
